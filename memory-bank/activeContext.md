# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is to establish the foundational Memory Bank files and ensure the project is in a stable state, starting with resolving any immediate errors. The current task was to fix a TypeScript error in `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`.

## Recent Changes
1.  **Installed `@types/node`:** Executed `npm i --save-dev @types/node`.
2.  **Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`:** Established the core project brief.
3.  **Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`:** Documented product context.
4.  **Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`:** Outlined system architecture and patterns.
5.  **Created `memory-bank/techContext.md`:** Detailed technologies and setup.
6.  **Created `memory-bank/activeContext.md`:** This file, tracking current work.
7.  **Created `memory-bank/progress.md`:** Documented project progress.
8.  **Created `.clinerules`:** Initialized project intelligence file.
9.  **Verified Error Resolution in `drizzle.config.ts`:** Ran `bun run check &> typecheck.log` and confirmed from `typecheck.log` that the TypeScript error (Cannot find name 'process') was resolved.
10. **Fixed TypeScript Error in `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`:** Modified `avatarUrl` and `deletedAt` fields by removing `.default(null)` to resolve `Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SQL<unknown> | Date'.` User confirmed the fix.

## Next Steps
1.  **Populate `DATABASE_URL`:** Ensure the `.env` file has `DATABASE_URL` set up for Drizzle to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This is crucial for any database operations.
2.  **Database Migrations:** Consider if `db:push` or `db:migrate` needs to be run if schema changes are expected or if this is an initial setup.
3.  **Await further tasks** from the user. The initial error is fixed, and the Memory Bank foundation is established.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
-   **Memory Bank First:** Successfully prioritized and created the core Memory Bank files and `.clinerules`.
-   **Incremental Creation & Verification:** Followed a step-by-step process, including verification of the error fix.
-   **Inferred Context:** The Memory Bank content is based on initial inferences and user instructions. It will require ongoing refinement.
