# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project, "Onion Roll Call," primarily exists to address and resolve technical issues within a codebase, starting with a TypeScript error in `drizzle.config.ts`. A secondary, but equally important, purpose is to establish a robust "Memory Bank" system. This system is designed to ensure project continuity and knowledge retention, especially given the engineer's (Cline's) memory resets between sessions.

## Problems It Solves
1.  **TypeScript Compilation Errors:** The immediate problem is a `Cannot find name 'process'` error in `drizzle.config.ts`, preventing successful compilation or execution.
2.  **Lack of Persistent Context:** The project aims to solve the challenge of maintaining context and project knowledge across development sessions due to memory resets. The Memory Bank will serve as the persistent source of truth.
3.  **Inefficient Onboarding/Re-onboarding:** Without a Memory Bank, each session would require re-discovering project details, leading to inefficiency.

## How It Should Work
-   **Error Resolution:** The application should compile and run without the specified TypeScript error. The `DATABASE_URL` should be correctly accessed from environment variables.
-   **Memory Bank Functionality:**
    *   The Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, and potentially others) must be created and maintained according to the user's defined structure and workflow.
    *   Cline (the AI engineer) MUST read all Memory Bank files at the start of EVERY task.
    *   Updates to the Memory Bank should occur upon discovering new patterns, after significant changes, upon user request ("update memory bank"), or when context needs clarification.
    *   A `.clinerules` file will capture project-specific intelligence, patterns, and user preferences.

## User Experience Goals
-   **For the End User (Implicit):** A stable and correctly functioning application, free of the initial TypeScript error.
-   **For the Developer (User interacting with Cline):**
    *   Clear and consistent updates from Cline regarding actions taken and the state of the Memory Bank.
    *   Confidence that Cline has the necessary context to perform tasks effectively, derived from the Memory Bank.
    *   Efficient problem-solving and task execution by Cline, minimizing the need for repeated explanations.
    *   A well-documented project state that is easy to understand through the Memory Bank.
