# Progress

## What Works
-   **TypeScript Error Resolution in `drizzle.config.ts`:** The `Cannot find name 'process'` error was resolved by installing `@types/node` and verified.
-   **TypeScript Error Resolution in `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`:** The `Argument of type 'null' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SQL<unknown> | Date'` error was resolved by removing `.default(null)` from nullable fields. User confirmed the fix.
-   **Core Memory Bank File Creation:** All core Memory Bank files have been created:
    *   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
    *   `memory-bank/productContext.md`
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md`
    *   `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
    *   `memory-bank/progress.md` (this file)
-   **`.clinerules` Creation:** The `.clinerules` file has been initialized.

## What's Left to Build
1.  **Database Connectivity:**
    *   Ensure a `.env` file exists and contains a valid `DATABASE_URL`.
    *   Verify Drizzle ORM can connect to the PostgreSQL database.
2.  **Database Migrations:**
    *   If this is an initial setup or if schema changes have occurred (e.g., in `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`), run Drizzle Kit migrations (e.g., `bun run db:push` or `bun run db:migrate`).
3.  **Full Project Functionality:** The overall purpose and features of the "Onion Roll Call" application are yet to be explored, implemented, or verified.
4.  **Application Features:** Specific features of the application need to be defined and developed.
5.  **Ongoing Memory Bank Maintenance:** Continuously update all Memory Bank files and `.clinerules` as the project evolves.

## Current Status
-   TypeScript errors in `drizzle.config.ts` and `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` are resolved.
-   The foundational Memory Bank and `.clinerules` are established.
-   The project is ready for further development, starting with database setup and then application-specific features.

## Known Issues
-   **Missing `.env` file / `DATABASE_URL` (Potential):** It's highly probable that a `.env` file with a valid `DATABASE_URL` is needed for the application to run correctly, especially for Drizzle ORM. This hasn't been set up or confirmed yet. If not present, database operations will fail.
-   **Memory Bank is New:** The Memory Bank content is based on initial inferences and user instructions. It will require ongoing refinement and updates as the project progresses and more is learned.
-   **Database Schema/Migrations:** The status of the database schema and whether migrations are needed is unknown.
