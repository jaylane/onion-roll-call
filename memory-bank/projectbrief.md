# Project Brief

## Project Name: Onion Roll Call

## Core Requirements:
- Fix a TypeScript error in `drizzle.config.ts` related to `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.
- Establish and maintain a robust Memory Bank system for project context and continuity.

## Goals:
- Ensure the application builds and runs without TypeScript errors.
- Create a comprehensive and well-structured Memory Bank that accurately reflects the project's state, decisions, and technical details.
- Adhere to the defined Memory Bank structure and workflows.
- Develop and maintain a `.clinerules` file to capture project-specific intelligence.

## Scope:
- Initial focus is on resolving the immediate TypeScript error.
- Subsequent focus is on building out the Memory Bank files as per the user's custom instructions.
- Ongoing maintenance of the Memory Bank and `.clinerules` throughout the project lifecycle.
